## Tech experience

I've worked on quite a few things in tech:

- Helped build the backend of the [KWOC backend](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/KWoC-Backend) in Go
- Designed and created on a few games in Unity and Godot, most impressive of which is [Fructomania!](https://signor-koala.itch.io/fructomania)
- Made a discord bot in Node.js for archiving all messages in a discord server with 800+ members (lost the source code a while ago tho ╥\_╥ )
- Designed and built a Health monitoring system for CABS, DRDO; in ANSI C (C89) on an RTOS
- Made a "smart" doorbell with a raspberry pi and python that could stream video and pictures over the internet to you and sent email notifications when activated (This was my DIY project).
- Have extensive experience in Linux server administration and related system administration. (Did i mention that i use Arch BTW?)

## Experience on this project

So this project was a lot of firsts for me. It was my first real deepdive into javascript as a web backend, my first time using a NoSQL database (Mongo), and my first forray into hugely abstracting 
frameworks.  

The first thing I did was revise javascript in general from MDN, since it had been some time since i used it.  
After which i went on to the documentation for expressjs. At this point, i was dumbfounded with how easy the framework made backend development, since i was used to dealing manually constructing HTTP
messages. As much as I *hate* to admit it, I finally started seeing the appeal of javascript's flexible typing system.  

It wasn't long until i ran into problems. I had setup a base system which just took in an input from the user via the HTML form. And ofcourse I got an expressjs validation error I didn't understand.
I then went back and forth between the documentation (RIP stackoverflow), guides, and my code. I ended up actually stumbling upon a bunch of other bugs in my code and reorganising my entire code 
until i finally stumbled upon the issue. I had used a different field name in the HTML form than was being used in JS, which the interpreter didn't catch....  

Not much else noteworthy happened, but the quick workflow I had definitely changed my attitude to how I would work on such projects. So yeah, twas a pretty good experience :)
